__User Story 1__\
Description: As a user, I can see events and reminders for at least 5 years in past from the todayâ€™s date.

Test strategy:
1. Will be tested in the test_get_upcoming_events_number method.
2. Using patch, the api for the google calendar api is mocked.
3. Set the time to be used in the function to obtain the event to the time on the local device
4. Call Calendar.get_all_events
5. Set assert to see if the function is called
6. Set the function to see if the number of events returned is the same as set
7. Check if the argument for timeMin is 5 years from now

__User Story 2__\
Description: As a user, I can see events and reminders for at least next two years (in future).

Test strategy:
1. Will be tested in the test_get_upcoming_events_number method.

3. Set the time to be used in the function to obtain the event to the time on the local device
4. Call Calendar.get_all_events
5. Set assert to see if the function is called
6. Set the function to see if the number of events returned is the same as set

__User Story 3__\
Description: As a user, I can navigate through different days, months, and years in the calendar so that I can view the details of events. For example, if the year 2019 is selected, all eventsand reminders (and any other information associated to the event) will be shown. This means on selecting the specific event or reminder I can see the detailed information.

__User Story 4__\
Description: As a user, I can search events and reminders using different key words.

Test Strategy:
1. Mock api, time_now and search_term for the events gathered
2. Call Calendar.search_all_events using the mocked variables
3. Check if mock_api.events.return_value.list.call_args_list[kwargs]['q'] is equal to the mocked search term
4. If it is the same then, the Calendar searches for the required events
